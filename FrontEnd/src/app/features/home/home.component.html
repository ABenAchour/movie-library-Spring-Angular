<br><h2>Movies Library</h2>
<p>
This project contains a  front End Angular Application we can search movies by filter ,add ,update and Delete 
</p><p>
The idea is to create a responsive front-end that consumes a RESTful web service that we will create. Users will be able to create their movies (or select movies if they already exist in the Json File ).
</p><p>
This project contains a back-end Spring Boot server retrieving data from a movies.json file using REST Api services exposed at http://localhost:8080/moviesLibrary. The Api controller contains view, creation, update, search and delete services.
</p><p>
 It is possible de view all data or to use an index to search one object. There is also another service, based on a key-value search criteria. In addition, a delete and update operations are available to modify objects list content. An integrity check is added before every process to control input parameters.
